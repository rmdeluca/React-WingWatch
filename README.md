# README

## Linux Installation
First clone the repository to a local directory:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/erikvcarlson/React-WingWatch.git
```

Next Install and start the frontent:

```shell
sudo apt install npm nodejs
```

change directory into the frontend directory

```shell
cd frontend
npm install 
```

start the frontend development server

```shell
npm start 
```

you should get a command that the frontend was compiled successfully and you can view the applet in the browser. Locally this will be at:

http://localhost:3000

For the applet to work, you also need to run the backend. In a new terminal, you will need to move into the backend directory and install the required packages using the python requirements file.

```shell
cd backend
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then start the backend using: 

```shell
python3 main.py
```

You should get a line that says: 

```shell
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

If you get an error regarding geos_c or libgeos, you may need to install it manually:

```shell
sudo apt install libgeos-dev
```

## Reporting an Issue
To report an issue, use the Issues tab in Github. Please provide the most robust information as possible. Helpful information and attachments includes: 

1) Output of the web console from the Chrome DevTools page (or equivalent in other browsers)

2) Screenshots of your indexeddb entires in the StationInformation, PatternInformation and AntennaInformation databases.

3) Any relevant antenna pattern files

## Minimal Working Example
1) Create your stations
    - Name of Station should be Station1 for first station Station2 for second station and Station3 for thrid station
    - Latitude and Longitude values should be 41.1479,-71.5901 for Station1, 41.1461,-71.5901 for Station2, and 41.1470,-71.5880 for Station3

2) Once all of the stations have been created, you can generate an antenna and assign a radiation pattern to it. In the dropdown menu located in the Station Creation Terminal, select a station. The antenna number should be the integrer 1. Untar the Fake_Calibration_Data.tar.gz file in the Minimal_Working_Example. Click the upload CSV for Pattern file and upload this untarred CSV. Click the Submit Pattern Button when this has been completed. 

3) Once all three stations have been initalized, you can pivot to the detection generator. Select each station in the corresponding Station dropdown menu. Use the integer value 1 in the antenna number for each station. 

4) For the minimal working example the strength of station detection is 72,73, and 66 respectively. Once all of the values have been entered hit the go button.
